<h2>Who is Michelle?</h2>
<p>Following in her older brother's footsteps, Michelle attended Princeton University, graduating cum laude in 1985 with a B.A. in Sociology. She went on to study law at Harvard Law School, where she took part in demonstrations calling for the enrollment and hiring of more minority students and professors. She was awarded her J.D. in 1988.</p>

<h3>Michelle Obama's Most Notable Speeches</h3>
<p>Obama Foundation Summit, November 18-19, 2018
  During a conversation with poet Elizabeth Alexander at the Obama Foundation's inaugural youth leadership summit in Chicago, in November 2018, the former first lady spoke about the problems with impulsively firing off thoughts on social media.
  
  "When you have a voice, you can't just use it any kind of way, you know?" she said. "You don't just say what's on your mind. You don't tweet every thought. Most of your first initial thoughts are not worthy of the light of day." It was believed to be a rebuke of President Trump, a notorious Twitter devotee, though Michelle clarified that she was "talking about all of us."
  
  Michelle also addressed the topic of protecting women from sexual harassment, a hot-button issue stemming from recent accusations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and others in position of power.
  
  "When we think about women in particular we ask them to speak up. We ask them to speak their mind. We ask them to just say no, to speak out against sexual harassment," Michelle said. "But if we don't teach our young girls to speak at an early age, that doesn't just happen. It takes practice to have a voice. You have to use it again, and again, and again before you can say 'no.' Or 'stop.' 'Don't touch me.'"</p>
